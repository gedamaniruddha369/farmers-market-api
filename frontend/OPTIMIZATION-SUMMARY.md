# PlanetWiseLiving Performance Optimization Summary

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization

- **Created LazyImage Component**: A reusable component that implements:
  - Lazy loading (images load only when they enter the viewport)
  - Responsive images with srcset for different device sizes
  - Placeholder images during loading
  - Smooth fade-in transitions
  - Proper descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO

- **Image Optimization Utilities**: Created utility functions for:
  - Generating optimized image URLs
  - Calculating responsive image dimensions
  - Creating placeholder colors
  - Verifying image existence

- **Improved Alt Text**: Updated all image alt text to be more descriptive and SEO-friendly

### 2. JavaScript and CSS Optimization

- **Webpack Configuration**: Set up a production-ready webpack configuration with:
  - Code splitting (separates vendor code from application code)
  - Minification of JavaScript and CSS
  - Tree shaking to eliminate unused code
  - Content hashing for long-term caching
  - Gzip compression for static assets

### 3. HTML Optimization

- **Preconnect Directives**: Added preconnect links to establish early connections to external domains:
  - Google Fonts
  - Unsplash (for images)

- **Critical CSS**: Inlined critical CSS for above-the-fold content

- **Deferred Loading**: Non-critical scripts are loaded with defer attribute

- **Loading Spinner**: Added a loading spinner that appears before React loads

### 4. Documentation

- **Optimization Guide**: Created a comprehensive guide explaining:
  - Image optimization techniques
  - JavaScript and CSS optimization
  - Caching strategies
  - Additional performance improvements

- **Installation Script**: Provided a script to install necessary optimization dependencies

## How to Use These Optimizations

1. **For Images**: Replace standard `<img>` tags with the `<LazyImage>` component:

```jsx
// Before
<img 
  src="image.jpg" 
  alt="Simple description" 
  className="some-class"
/>

// After
<LazyImage 
  src="image.jpg" 
  alt="Detailed, descriptive alt text with keywords" 
  className="some-class"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>
```

2. **For Production Builds**: 
   - Install the required dependencies using the provided script
   - Add the build scripts to your package.json
   - Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build

## Next Steps

1. **Google Analytics and Search Console**: Set up after deploying to Hostinger
2. **Service Worker**: Implement for offline capabilities and caching
3. **Image CDN**: Consider using Cloudinary or Imgix for further image optimization
4. **Server Caching Headers**: Configure proper cache headers on the server

## Performance Testing

After implementing these optimizations, use the following tools to measure improvements:

1. **Lighthouse** (in Chrome DevTools)
2. **WebPageTest**
3. **Google PageSpeed Insights**

These optimizations should significantly improve your Core Web Vitals scores and overall user experience.
